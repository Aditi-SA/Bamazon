# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like online store front.
The app takes in the orders (ID and quantity of the product) and depletes the stock from store's inventory.

This is a CLI application.

## Customer Interface

* The Customerr runs the app with the command 'node bamazoncustomer.js'
  This shows a list of all products available in the store with the relevant department, price and stock quantity information.

* With the use of arrow buttons select the product to buy.
  Then enter the number of units of the selected product to be bought.  
  The application rings up the purchase and shows the customer the total cost of their purchase.
  Bamazon then takes in the stock inventory and makes the relevant changes to it based on customer input.
* The application also check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, it prevents the order from      going through.
